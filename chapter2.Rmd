# Regression and model validation

I have completed the data wrangling exercises: I've read the data from the file with the help of *read.csv* function, created a new dataset by taking columns from the old one and written it to a new file (*write.csv*).

## Analysis exercises

```{r}
lrn2014 <- read.csv('data/lrn2014.csv')
str(lrn2014)
dim(lrn2014)
```
The dataset consists of 166 observations and 7 variables.
